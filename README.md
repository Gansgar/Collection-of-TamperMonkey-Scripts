# Collection-of-TamperMonkey-Scripts
This is a collection of scripts I use personally in TamperMonkey

## Setup
Currently I'm using Chrome with the chrome flag `enable-force-dark` to `Enabled with selective image inversion`. So some scripts are here just to change the CSS to make the page compatible with this flag.
