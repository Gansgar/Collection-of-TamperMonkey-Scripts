# Collection-of-TamperMonkey-Scripts
This is a collection of scripts I use personally in TamperMonkey

## Setup
Currently I'm using Chrome with the chrome flag `enable-force-dark` to `Enabled with selective image inversion`. So some scripts are here just to change the CSS to make the page compatible with this flag.

## Other
### Automatic redirect to Wikipedia Mobile on Desktop
This was my first TamperMonkey script and it does what the title states. 
I find the mobile page to help me keep the focus better.
